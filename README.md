# CIS 3500: Nara Extension Starter

## Enhancements

Speech Bubble Encouragement - Whenever a user checks off a task, a cheerful speech bubble appears near the deer character with a short, uplifting message like ‚ÄúGreat job!‚Äù, ‚ÄúKeep going!‚Äù, or ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre making progress!‚Äù. This feature is designed to create a more emotionally supportive and rewarding experience as users complete their daily goals, reinforcing positive habits through gentle visual feedback.

Mood Selection Prompt - At the start of each session, users are invited to log how they're feeling by selecting from five mood options: happy, neutral, stressed, sad, or mad ‚Äî each represented by a simple emoji. This quick emotional check-in helps users reflect on their mental state and encourages mindfulness as part of their daily routine. The selected mood is visually highlighted and stored locally for a more personalized experience.

## Overview

This assignment involves enhancing a Chrome extension developed by one of the Top 3 winners of the MCIT hackathon. The project provides hands-on experience in web development, API integration, and collaborative coding.

**Original project:** [Nara](https://github.com/luyiZhang818/Nara-Chrome-Extension)

## Project Description

Nara is a Chrome extension that helps users manage their tasks and reminders efficiently. Your task is to enhance this extension by implementing new features.

## Enhancement Options

Choose one of the following enhancements to implement:

1. **Speech Bubble Encouragement**: Implement a feature where, whenever the user checks off a task, a speech or thought bubble appears near the deer with a short, encouraging message (e.g., ‚ÄúGreat job!‚Äù, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre making progress!‚Äù, ‚ÄúKeep going!‚Äù).
2. **Daily Gratitude Log**: Implement a small text area where users can note one thing they‚Äôre grateful for each day. Over time, they can revisit a dedicated ‚Äúgratitude log‚Äù to see their positive moments. Provide an interesting method to save these entries and display them on a separate screen so users can easily access their past entries.
3. **Mood Selection Prompt**: Implement a simple mood selection feature(e.g., happy, stressed, neutral) with a small icon or emoji. This allows users to log their emotional state quickly each day.
4. **Rotating Weekly Challenge**: Implement a weekly challenge system‚Äîsuch as ‚ÄúDrink 8 glasses of water each day‚Äù or ‚ÄúTake a 10-minute walk daily.‚Äù Users can check off these mini-challenges alongside their normal tasks for extra motivation.
5. **Inspirational Quote Overlay**: Implement a short inspirational quote or positive affirmation that appears on each new tab, displayed in a subtle text overlay.
6. **Implement a History Feature**: Maintain a log of all tasks and reminders created by the user, allowing them to revisit past items and track progress over time.
7. **Custom Feature**: Propose a unique feature (requires instructor/TA approval).

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Team Organization

- Assign a team member as the **Product Manager (PM)** for Nara.
- Ensure this PM is different from the one assigned to the Lunch Lotto project.

### Step 2: Repository Setup

The PM should fork the repository:

1. Navigate to the `nara-extension-starter` repository on GitHub.
2. Click the **Fork** button to create a copy under their account.

### Step 3: Cloning the Repository

Once the PM has forked the repository, team members should clone it locally:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/<PM-username>/nara-extension-starter.git
```

### Step 4: Development Workflow

1. Open the project in a text editor (e.g., **Visual Studio Code** recommended).
2. Make changes to the codebase.
3. Use the following commands to commit and push your changes:

```sh
git add .
git commit -m "feat: [feature name] added"
git push
```

4. As team members contribute, collaborate using **Pull Requests (PRs)** on GitHub.
5. Regularly sync your local repository with the latest changes:

```sh
git pull
```

6. Resolve merge conflicts as needed and ensure smooth integration.

## Submission

- Submit the final version of your project as per course guidelines.
- Include a brief write-up of your implemented features and any challenges faced.
